              The ITL Network was established as a registered not-for-profit under the Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act 
              to respond to the unique challenges faced by internationally trained legal professionals. What began as a community 
              to support candidates navigating the licensing process has grown into a platform for mentorship, professional development, 
              and advocacy.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              A key pillar of our work is the ITL Conference â€” the national conference for internationally trained lawyers, held annually 
              in partnership with fellow equity-seeking groups. The conference attracts impactful speakers and brings together hundreds 
              of ITLs from across Canada to deliberate, connect, network, learn, and inspire each other.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Alongside the conference, our Revamped Mentorship Program connects ITLs with experienced lawyers and leaders in the profession, 
              offering tailored guidance on licensing, career advancement, and building sustainable practices. Complementing this, our Membership 
              Platform provides year-round access to resources, networking opportunities, and exclusive programming designed to foster growth, 
              collaboration, and long-term success.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Through these initiatives, we are building a strong, connected network that promotes equitable access to opportunities and strengthens 
              the future of the Canadian legal profession.
